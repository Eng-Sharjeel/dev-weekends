ðŸ“Œ Problem 1: Jewels and Stones

******** Problem Statement ********

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

******** Understanding *********

We have two strings:

jewels: contains unique characters â†’ types of jewels.
stones: contains stones we own.
Task: Count how many characters in stones are also present in jewels.

********* Example ********
jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb" â†’ Output = 3
jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ" â†’ Output = 0

******** Appraoch ********

Option 1: Brute Force

For each character in stones, loop over jewels to check if it exists.
Increment count if found.
Time: O(n*m)

Option 2: Optimized (HashSet) âœ…

Store all jewels in a set (quick lookup).
Loop through stones â†’ if stone is in set â†’ increment count.
Time: O(n+m), Space: O(m)

    cout << sol.numJewelsInStones("z", "ZZ") << endl;       // Output: 0
    return 0;

// approach 2:

public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        int count=0;
        int n=jewels.size();
