ðŸ“Œ Problem 4: Merge Strings Alternately (Using While Loop)

******** Problem Statement ********

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"

Example 2:
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"

Example 3:
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"

********* Understanding ********

We merge two strings character by character alternately.
- Start with word1[0], then word2[0], and so on.
- If one string is longer, append remaining characters at the end.

********* Approach **********

Two pointer technique â†’ handle both strings simultaneously.
Separate loops â†’ cleanly handle the case when strings are of unequal lengths.
